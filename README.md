HTML starter for c:/xampp/htdocs/html/oop

Files added:
- index.html — main page you can open in a browser or serve with XAMPP.
- css/style.css — basic responsive styles with light/dark theme support.
- js/script.js — small JS demo (theme toggle + form interaction).

How to use
1. Open the file directly in a browser: open `c:/xampp/htdocs/html/oop/index.html`.
2. Or serve it with XAMPP: place the folder under XAMPP's `htdocs` (already under that path) and visit http://localhost/html/oop/.

Notes
- This is intentionally minimal. If you want a PHP example, template engine, or a build setup (npm), tell me which and I'll add it.
